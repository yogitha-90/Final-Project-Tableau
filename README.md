# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
I selected to work with Option 2 which was a cleaned data set of Airbnb.The goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis, observe trends and patterns . Use those initial observations to tell a meaningful story through visualizations.

## Process
### (your step 1)

I choose Airbnb data for option 2 to do this project.
Connected to the data through Tableau and detected different data types:
The data has 30478 records of property names with 13 attributes
The goal of the project is to do the exploratory data analysis, observe trends patterns and through initial observations to tell a meaningful story through visualization.
The most important features from the data set are

Geographic locations

Property types

Price

Reviews 

Date



### (your step 2)

During EDA these were the questions formulated.

Is there any variation of price based on city?

Cities with higher number of Airbnb’s?

Is there any relationship between price, property type  and time?

What’s the forecast for 2015 and 2016?

Most profitable quarter for Airbnb?

Highest reviewed host, highest earning host and host with highest records?

Is there any relationship between joining date of host and number of reviews?


Dashboards and woorkbooks were then focused on attempting to find answers to these questions

# Rationale for choice of visualizations

Maps

Bar graphs

Line graphs

Clusters

Table 

Packed bubbles

Tree maps


## Results

Visaualization maps are created to describe the relationship between the airbnb and cities where Manhatten has the highest number of Airbnb.

Visualization map is created to describe the relationship between the prices and cities, where Manhantten ranks first

Built a workbook to explain the trend in price of apartment and house with time where The apartment prices grew very much faster when compared to the house.
The p value is very low making it statistically significant.

Built a workbook to forecast the prices for 2015-2016 based on available data.

Built an interactive dashboard for host parameters and enabled filters to help viewers to get a clear idea about records, reviews, earnings and joining date of host.

## Challenges 
I initially started working on Option 1 because I felt my data visualization skills were insufficient for a standalone task. I spent four to five hours trying to connect the other Excel files together, but failed. so I choose option 2 to further proceed with the project.

## Future Goals
I would do further analysis to produce more insights from the Airbnb data.
